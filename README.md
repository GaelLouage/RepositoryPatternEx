Introduction

The Repository Pattern is a design pattern that mediates data access and business logic by abstracting data operations into repositories. This project also demonstrates the use of LINQ to implement custom filtering logic for entities.
Features

    CRUD Operations: Add, remove, update, and retrieve entities.
    Custom Filtering: Implement complex business rules using LINQ.
    Dependency Injection: Repositories are registered as services, following best practices for scalability and testability.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

    .NET SDK (version 6.0 or later)

Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-pattern-linq.git

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd repository-pattern-linq

Build the project:

bash

    dotnet build

Usage

You can run the application using:

bash

dotnet run

The application exposes an HTTP endpoint where you can perform CRUD operations and test custom business rules.
Example

To update a customer's product list with a new product, navigate to:

http

http://localhost:5000/

The customer with the name "John Doe" will have a new product "AlienWare" added to their product list.
Architecture

    Models: Represent the data entities like Customer, Order, and Product.
    Repositories: Implement the Repository Pattern, managing data operations and custom filtering logic.
    Helpers: Include utility classes for handling data operations.
    Data: Mock data for customers, orders, and products.
